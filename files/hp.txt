            DUMBLEDORE

I should've known you would have been 
here Professor McGonagall.

            MCGONAGALL

Good evening Professor Dumbledore. Are 
the rumors true Albus?

            DUMBLEDORE

I'm afraid so Professor. The good and 
the bad.

            MCGONAGALL

And the boy?

            DUMBLEDORE

Hagrid is bringing him.

            MCGONAGALL

Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid 
w/ something as important as this?


            DUMBLEDORE

Ah, Prof. I would trust Hagrid w/ my 
life

            HAGRID

Professor. Dumbledore, sir. Professor 
McGonagall.

            DUMBLEDORE

No problems I trust Hagrid?

            HAGRID

No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep as 
we were flying over Bristol. Try not 
to wake him. There you go.

            MC 

Albus, do really think it's safe leaving 
him with these people? I've watched 
them all day. There're the worst sort 
of Muggles imaginable. They really are- 
-

            DUMBLEDORE

The only family he has.

            MCGONAGALL

This boy will be famous. There won't 
be a child in our world who doesn't 
know his name.

            DUMBLEDORE

Exactly. He's far better off growing 
up away from all of that. Until he is 
ready. There, there Hagrid. It's not 
really goodbye after all. Good Luck, 
HARRY Potter.

            AUNT PETUNIA

Up. Get up! Now!

            DUDLEY

Wake up cousin! We're going to the zoo!


            AUNT PETUNIA

Here he comes the birthday boy!

            UNCLE VERNON

happy birthday son.

            AUNT PETUNIA

Why don't you just cook the breakfast 
and try not to burn anything.

            HARRY

Yes Aunt Petunia.

            AUNT PETUNIA

I want everything to be perfect for 
my Dudley's special day!

            UNCLE VERNON

Hurry up! Bring my coffee boy!

            HARRY

yes Uncle Vernon.

            AUNT PETUNIA

Aren't they wonderful darling?

            DUDLEY

How many are there?

            VOLDEMORT

36, Counted them myself.

            DUDLEY

36?! BUT LAST YEAR LAST YEAR I HAD 37!!!


            VOLDEMORT

Yes, but some of them are a bit bigger 
than last year's!

            DUDLEY

I don't care how big they are!

            AUNT PETUNIA

Now, now, now, this is what we're going 
to do. Is that when we go out we're 
going to buy you 2 new presents. How's 
that pumpkin?

            


            AUNT PETUNIA

It should be a lovely day at the zoo. 
I'm really looking forward to it.


            VOLDEMORT

I'm warning you now boy. Any funny business, 
any at all and you won't have any meals 
for a week. Get in.

            


            DUDLEY

Make it move.

            VOLDEMORT

Move.

            DUDLEY

MOVE!

            HARRY

He's asleep.

            DUDLEY

He's boring.

            HARRY

Sorry about him he doesn't understand 
what it's like, lying there day after 
day watching people press their ugly 
faces in on you. Can you hear me? It's 
just I've never talked to a snake before. 
Do you... Do you talk to people often? 
You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it 
nice there? Did you miss your family? 
I see. That's me as well. I never knew 
my parents either.

            DUDLEY

Mummy, Dad, come here you won't believe 
what this snake is doing! Woah! Woah! 
Ah!

            SNAKE

Thanks.

            HARRY

Any time.

            OTH

Snake! Ahh!

            DUDLEY

Mum! Mummy! Help me!

            PERCY

My darling boy! How did you get in there! 
Who did this? How did you get in there? 
Is there a snake?

            


            

- - - -

            PERCY

It's all right sweetheart. We'll get 
you out of these terrible clothes.


            VOLDEMORT

What happened?

            HARRY

I swear, I don't know! One minute the 
glass was there then it was gone, it 
was like magic!

            VOLDEMORT

There's no such thing as magic.

            


            VOLDEMORT

Oh Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.


            DUDLEY

Dad! Look! HARRY's got a letter!

            HARRY

Hey give it back! It's mine!

            VOLDEMORT

Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

            


            VOLDEMORT

No more mail through this letterbox.


            


            AUNT PETUNIA

Have a lovely day at the office, dear.


            VOLDEMORT

Shoo! Go on!

            


            VOLDEMORT

Fine day Sunday. In my opinion best 
day of the week. And why is that Dudley?


            HARRY

Because there's no post on Sundays.


            VOLDEMORT

Right you are HARRY. No post on Sunday. 
Ha! No blasted letters today! No, sir! 
Not one single bloody letter! Not one! 
No sir, not one blasted, miserable- 
-

            DUDLEY

Make it stop, please!

            VOLDEMORT

Stop it!

            DUDLEY

Mummy what's happening?

            VOLDEMORT

Give me that! Give me that letter!


            HARRY

Get off! They're my letters! Let go 
of me!

            VOLDEMORT

That's it! We're going away, far away! 
Where they can't find us!

            DUDLEY

Daddy's gone mad hasn't he?

            

- - - -

            HARRY

Make a wish, HARRY.

            VOLDEMORT

Who's there?

            HAGRID

Sorry 'bout that.

            VOLDEMORT

I demand that you leave at once. You 
are breaking and entering.

            HAGRID

Dry up Dursley you great prune. Well, 
I haven't seen you since you was a baby 
HARRY. But you're a bit more along then 
I would have expected; particularly 
around the middle.

            DUDLEY

I'm not... I'm not HARRY.

            HARRY

I am.

            HAGRID

Well of course you are! Got something 
for you. Afraid I might have sat on 
it at some point but I imagine it'll 
taste fine just the same. Baked it myself, 
words and all.

            HARRY

Thank you!

            HAGRID

It's not everyday your young man turns 
11 now it is?

            HARRY

Excuse me, but who are you?

            HAGRID

Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds 
at Hogwarts. Of course you know all 
about Hogwarts

            HARRY

Sorry, no.

            HAGRID

No? Blimey HARRY didn't you ever wonder 
didn't you ever wonder how your mum 
and dad learned it all?

            HARRY

Learned what?

            HAGRID

You're a wizard HARRY.

            HARRY

I'm a what?

            HAGRID

A wizard. And a thumpin' good one I'd 
wager once you've trained up a bit.


            HARRY

No, you've made a mistake. I mean I 
can't be a wizard... I mean I'm HARRY, 
Just HARRY.

            HAGRID

Well, "Just HARRY" did you ever make 
anything happen? Anything you couldn't 
explain, when you were angry or scared? 
Um Hum.

            HARRY

Dear Mr. Potter, we are pleased to inform 
you that you have been accepted at the 
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.


            VOLDEMORT

He will not be going! We swore when 
we took him in that we would put a stop 
to all of this rubbish!

            HARRY

You knew? We knew all along and you 
never told me?

            AUNT PETUNIA

Of course we knew. How could you not 
be? My perfect being who she was. Oh 
I remember the day she got her letter. 
My parents were so proud. We have a 
witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? 
I was the only one who saw her for what 
she was... a freak. And then she met 
that Potter, and then she had you and 
I knew you would be the same just as 
strange just as abnormal. And then, 
if you please, she got herself blown 
up, and we got landed with you.

            HARRY

Blown up?! You told me my parents died 
in a car crash!

            HAGRID

A car crash? A car crash killed Lily 
and James Potter?

            PAT

We had to say something!

            HAGRID

It's an outrage. It's a scandal.

            VOLDEMORT

He will not be going.

            HAGRID

Oh and I suppose a great Muggle like 
yourself is gonna stop him.

            HARRY

Muggle?

            HAGRID

Non- magic folk. This boy's had his 
name down since he were born. He's going 
to the finest school of witchcraft and 
wizardry in the world. And he'll be 
under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts 
has ever seen, Albus Dumbledore...


            VOLDEMORT

I will not pay to have some crack pot 
old fool teach him magic tricks!

            HAGRID

Never insult Albus Dumbledore in front 
of me... I'd appreciate it if you didn't 
tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. 
Strictly speaking I'm not supposed to 
do magic.

            HARRY

OK

            HAGRID

We're a bit behind schedule. Best be 
off. Unless you'd rather stay, of course. 


            

- - - -

            HARRY

All students must be equipped with a 
one standard size two pewter cauldron, 
and may bring, if they desire, either 
an owl, a cat, or a toad. Can we find 
all this in London?

            HAGRID

If you know where to go.

            TOM (BARTENDER)

Ah, Hagrid the usual I presume.

            HAGRID

No thanks Tom, I'm on official Hogwarts 
business. Just helping young HARRY buy 
his school business.

            TOM

Bless my soul, it's HARRY Potter.

            OTHER

Welcome back Mr. Potter welcome back.


            DORIS

Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't 
believe I'm meeting you at last.

            QUIRRELL

HARRY P-p-potter. C-can't tell you how 
p-pleased I am to meet you.

            HAGRID

hello, professor I didn't see you there. 
HARRY Professor Quirrell will be your 
defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.


            HARRY

Oh, nice to meet you,

            QUIRRELL

A fearfully fascinating subject. N-not 
that you need it, eh, P-potter?

            HAGRID

Yes, well must be going now. Lots to 
buy.

            HARRY

Good bye.

            HAGRID

See, HARRY? You're famous.

            HARRY

But why am I famous Hagrid? All those 
people back there how is it they know 
who I am?

            HAGRID

I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person 
to tell you that, HARRY. Welcome HARRY, 
to Diagon Alley. That's where you get 
your quills and ink. Over there, all 
your bits and bobs for doing wizardry.


            OTH

It's a world class racing broom.

            OTH

Wow! Look at it the new Nimbus 2000! 
It's the fastest model yet!

            HARRY

But Hagrid how am I to pay for all this? 
I haven't any money.

            HAGRID

Well there's your money HARRY! Gringotts, 
the wizard bank! Ain't no safer place, 
not one! 'Cept perhaps Hogwarts.

            HARRY

Hagrid what exactly are these things?


            HAGRID

They're goblins HARRY. Clever as they 
come the goblins, but not the most friendly 
of beasts. Best stay close. Mr. HARRY 
Potter wishes to make a withdrawal


            GOBLIN

And does Mr. HARRY Potter have his key?


            HAGRID

Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. 
Ha! There's the little devil. Oh, and 
there's something else as well. Professor 
Dumbledore gave me this. It's about 
You- Know- What in vault you know which.


            GOBLIN

Very well.

            GRIPHOOK

Vault 687. Lamp please. Key, please


            HAGRID

Didn't think your mum and dad would 
leave you with nothing now did you?


            GRIPHOOK

Vault 713.

            HARRY

What's in there Hagrid?

            HAGRID

Can't tell you HARRY. Hogwarts business. 
Very secret.

            GRIPHOOK

Stand back.

            HAGRID

Best not to mention this to anyone HARRY.


            HARRY

I still need... a wand.

            HAGRID

A wand? Well, you want Ollivander's. 
There ain't no place better. Why don't 
you run along and wait. I got one more 
thing to do. Won't be long.

            HARRY

Hello? Hello?

            OLLI

I wondered when I'd be seeing you Mr. 
Potter. It seems only yesterday that 
you mother and father were in here buying 
their first wands. Here we are. Well 
give it a wave. Apparently not. Perhaps 
this. NO, no definitely not. No matter. 
I wonder... Curious... very curious


            HARRY

Sorry but what's curious

            OLLI

I remember every wand that I've sold 
Mr. Potter, every one. It so happens 
that the phoenix whose tail feather 
resides in your wand, gave another feather. 
Just one other. It is curious that you 
should be destined for this wand when 
its brother gave you that scar.

            HARRY

And who owned that wand?

            OLLI

We do not speak his name. The wand chooses 
the wizard Mr. Potter. It is not always 
clear why. But I think it is clear that 
we can expect great things from you. 
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named 
did great things. Terrible, yes, but 
great.

            HAGRID

HARRY! HARRY! Happy Birthday!

            HARRY

Woah!

            HAGRID

You all right HARRY? You seem very quiet.


            HARRY

He killed my parents didn't he? The 
one who gave me this. You know Hagrid. 
I know you do.

            HAGRID

First and understand this HARRY because 
it's very important. Not all wizards 
are good. Some of them go bad. A few 
years ago one of them went as bad as 
you can go. His name was V--. His name 
was V--.

            HARRY

Well maybe if you wrote it down?

            HAGRID

Naw I can't spell it. All right, Voldemort.


            HARRY

Voldemort?

            HAGRID

Shh. It was dark times HARRY, dark times. 
Voldemort started to gather some followers. 
Brought them over to the Dark Side. 
Anyone who stood up to him ended up 
dead. Your parents fought against him. 
Nobody lived once he decided to kill 
them. Nobody, not one. Except you.


            HARRY

Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

            HAGRID

Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your 
forehead HARRY. A mark from that only 
comes from being touched by a curse, 
an evil curse at that.

            HARRY

What happened to V--... To You-Know-Who?


            HAGRID

Well some say he died. Codswallop in 
my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out 
there still too tired to carry on. But 
one thing's absolutely certain. Something 
about you stumped him that night. That's 
why you're famous. That's why everybody 
knows your name. You're the boy who 
lived.

            HAGRID

Well some say he died. Codswallop in 
my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out 
there still too tired to carry on. But 
one thing's absolutely certain. Something

- - - -

            HAGRID

What are you looking at? Blimey is that 
time? Sorry HARRY, but I'm gonna have 
to leave you. Dumbledore would be wanting 
his... Well, he'd be wanting to see 
me. Now, your train leaves in 10 minutes. 
Here's your ticket. Stick to it HARRY, 
that's very important. Stick to you 
ticket.

            HARRY

Platform 9 ¾? But, Hagrid, there must 
be a mistake. This says Platform 9 ¾. 
There's no such thing. Is there?

            OTH

Sorry.

            HARRY

Excuse me! Excuse me!

            OTH

On your left.

            HARRY

Excuse me sir. Can you tell me where 
I might find Platform 9 ¾?

            OTH

9 ¾? Think you're being funny do you?


            MRS. WEASLEY

It's the same every year packed with 
Muggles of course. Come on!

            HARRY

Muggles?

            MRS. WEASLEY

Platform 9 ¾ this way! All right Percy 
you first. Fred you next.

            GEORGE WEASLEY

He's not Fred I am!

            FRED WEASLEY

Honestly, woman you call yourself our 
mother!

            MRS. WEASLEY

I'm sorry George.

            FRED WEASLEY

Only joking! I am Fred.

            HARRY

Excuse me! Could you tell me how to...


            MRS. WEASLEY

How to get on to the platform? Yes, 
not to worry dear, it's Ron's first 
time to Hogwarts as well. Now, all you 
have to do is walk straight at the wall 
between platforms 9 and 10. Best do 
it at a run if you're nervous.

            GINNY

Good luck!

            RON WEASLEY

Excuse me, do you mind? Every where 
else is full.

            HARRY

Not at all.

            RON WEASLEY

I'm Ron by the way! Ron Weasley.

            HARRY

I'm HARRY. HARRY Potter.

            RON WEASLEY

SO it's true! DO you really have the... 
the...

            HARRY

The what?

            RON WEASLEY

The scar?

            HARRY

Oh!

            RON WEASLEY

Wicked!

            OTH

Anything off the trolley dears?

            RON WEASLEY

No, thanks, I'm all set.

            HARRY

We'll take the lot!

            RON WEASLEY

Woah!

            HARRY

Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?

            RON WEASLEY

They mean every flavor! There's chocolate, 
peppermint and also, spinach liver, 
and tripe. George sweared he got boogie 
flavored one once.

            HARRY

These aren't real frogs are they?

            RON WEASLEY

It's just a spell. But it's the cards 
you want. Each pack's got a famous witch 
or wizard. I got about 500 me self. 
Watch it! That's rotten luck. They've 
only got one good jump in them to begin 
with.

            HARRY

I've got Dumbledore!

            RON WEASLEY

I've got about 6 of him.

            HARRY

Hey, he's gone!

            RON WEASLEY

Well you can't expect him to hang around 
all day, can you? This is Scabbers by 
the way. Pathetic isn't he?

            HARRY

Just a little bit.

            RON WEASLEY

Fred gave me a spell to turn him yellow. 
Want to see?

            HARRY

Yeah!

            RON WEASLEY

Ahem... Sunshine...

            HERMIONE

has anyone seen a toad? A boy named 
Neville's has one.

            RON WEASLEY

No.

            HERMIONE

Oh are you doing magic? Let's see then.


            RON WEASLEY

Ahem. Sunshine Daisies Butter Mellow 
Turn this stupid fat rat yellow.

            HERMIONE

Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, 
it's not very good is it? Of course, 
I've only tried a few simple ones myself 
but they've all worked for me. For example: 
Oculus Reparo. That's better isn't it? 
Holy cricket! You're HARRY Potter! I'm 
Hermione Granger. And you are...?


            RON WEASLEY

I'm Ron Weasley.

            HERMIONE

Pleasure. You two better change into 
your robes. I expect we'll be arriving 
soon. You've dirt on your nose by the 
way. Just there.

            HAGRID

Right then. First years this way, please! 
First years, don't be shy. Come on now, 
hurry up! Hello HARRY!

            HARRY

Hi Hagrid!

            RON WEASLEY

Woah!

            HAGRID

Right, then. This way to the boats. 
Come on now, follow me.

            RON WEASLEY

            MCGONAGALL

Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments 
you will pass through these doors and 
join your classmates. But before you 
take your seats, you must be sorted 
into your houses. They are Gryffindor, 
Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. 
Now while you're here your house will 
be like your family. Your triumphs will 
earn you points. Any rule breaking and 
you will loose points. At the end of 
the year, the houses with the most points 
is awarded the house cup.

            NEVILLE

Trevor! Sorry.

            MCGONAGALL

The Sorting Ceremony will begin momentarily.


            DRACO MALFOY

It's true then, what they're saying 
on the train. HARRY Potter has come 
to Hogwarts.

            N & OTH

HARRY Potter?

            DRACO MALFOY

This is Crabbe and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy. 
Draco Malfoy. Think my name's funny 
do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair 
and a hand-me-down robe? You must be 
a Weasley. You'll soon find out that 
some wizarding families are better than 
others, Potter. You don't want to making 
friends with the wrong sort. I can help 
you there.

            HARRY

I think I can tell the wrong sort for 
my self thanks.

            MCGONAGALL

We're ready for you. Follow me.

            HERMIONE

It's not real the ceiling. It's just 
bewitched to look like the night outside. 
I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.


            MCGONAGALL

Will you wait along here please. Now 
before we begin, Professor Dumbledore 
would like to say a few words.

            DUMBLEDORE

I have a few start-of-term notices I 
wish to announce. The first years please 
note, that the Dark Forest is strictly 
forbidden to all students. Also, our 
caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to 
remind you that the third floor corridor 
on the right hand side is out of bounds 
to all who do not wish to die a most 
painful death. Thank you.

            MCGONAGALL

When I call your name you will come 
forth, I shall place the Sorting Hat 
on your head, and you will be sorted 
into your houses. Hermione Granger!


            HERMIONE

Oh, no. OK relax.

            RON WEASLEY

Mental that one, I'm telling you.

            SHARRY

Ah, right then. Hum... Right. Okay, 
Gryffindor!

            MCGONAGALL

Draco Malfoy!

            SHARRY

Slytherin!

            RON WEASLEY

There's no witch or wizard who went 
bad who wasn't in Slytherin.

            MCGONAGALL

Susan Bones!

            HARRY

Ow!

            RON WEASLEY

HARRY what is it?

            HARRY

Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine

            SHARRY

...where shall I put you? Let's see... 
I know! Hufflepuff!

            MCGONAGALL

Ronald Weasley!

            SHARRY

Ha! Another Weasley! I know just what 
to do with you... Gryffindor!

            MCGONAGALL

HARRY potter

            SHARRY

Hmmm... Difficult, very difficult. Plenty 
of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. 
There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst 
to prove yourself. But where to put 
you...

            HARRY

Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

            SHARRY

Not Slytherin eh? Are you sure? You 
could be great you know. It's all herein 
your head. And Slytherin will help you 
on the way to greatness, there's no 
doubt about that. No? (HARRY whispering: 
Please, Please anything but Slytherin, 
anything but Slytherin.) Well if you're 
sure, better be... Gryffindor!

            MCGONAGALL

Your attention please.

            DUMBLEDORE

Let the feast begin!

            HARRY

Wow!

            SFRED WEASLEY

I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle, 
mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock 
for him when he found out!

            HARRY

Say Percy, who's that teacher talking 
to Professor Quirrell?

            PERCY

Oh, Professor Snape, head of Slytherin 
house.

            HARRY

What's he teach?

            PERCY

Potions. But everyone knows it's the 
Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after 
Quirrell's job for years.

            RON WEASLEY

Ah!

            SIR NEVILLE

Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor.


            OTH

It's the Bloody Baron!

            PERCY

Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?


            SIR NEVILLE

Dismal. Once again my request to join 
the Headless Hunt has been denied.


            RON WEASLEY

I know you. You're Nearly Headless Nick.


            SIR NEVILLE

I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind.


            HERMIONE

"Nearly" headless? How can you be "nearly" 
headless?

            SIR NEVILLE

Like this.

            RON WEASLEY

Ah!

            

- - - -

            PERCY

Gryffindors, follow me, please. Keep 
up. Thank-you.

            OTH

Ravenclaw follow me. This way.

            PERCY

This is the most direct part to the 
dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on 
the staircases, they like to change. 
Keep up please, and follow me. Quickly 
now, come on. Come on.

            OTH

That picture's moving!

            OTH

Look at that one.

            OTH

I think she fancies you.

            OTH

Look, look!

            OTH

Who's that girl?

            WALL PICTURE

Welcome to Hogwarts!

            THE FAT LADY

Password?

            PERCY

Caput Draconis. Follow me, everyone. 
Keep up. Quickly, come on! Gather around 
here. Welcome to the Gryffindor common 
room. Boys' dormitories is upstairs 
and down to your left. Girls the same 
on your right. You'll find all your 
belonging have already been brought 
up.

            


            

- - - -

            RON WEASLEY

Whew! We made it! Can you imagine the 
look on McGonagall's face if we were 
late? That was bloody brilliant!

            MCGONAGALL

Thank-you for that assessment Mr. Weasley. 
Perhaps it would be more useful if I 
transfigured Mr. Potter and yourself 
into a pocket watch. That way one of 
you might be on time.

            HARRY

We got lost.

            MCGONAGALL

Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't 
need one to find your seats.

            


            SEVERUS SNAPE

There will be no foolish wand-waving 
or silly incantations in this class. 
As such, I don't expect many of you 
to appreciate the subtle science and 
exact art that is potion making. However, 
for those select few who possess the 
predisposition. I can teach you how 
to bewitch the mind and ensnare the 
senses. I show you how to bottle fame, 
brew glory, and even put a stopper in 
death. Then again maybe some of you 
have come to Hogwarts in possession 
of abilities so formidable that you 
feel confident enough to not pay attention. 
Mr. Potter, our new celebrity. Tell 
me what would I get if I added root 
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? 
You don't know? Well let's try again. 
Where Mr. Potter would you look if I 
asked you to find me a bezoar?

            HARRY

I don't know, sir.

            SEVERUS SNAPE

And what is the difference between monkswood 
and wolfsbane?

            HARRY

I don't know sir.

            SEVERUS SNAPE

Pity. Clearly fame isn't everything. 
Is it Mr. Potter?

            


            SFRED WEASLEY

Eye of rabbit, harp sting hum, turn 
this water into rum... Eye of rabbit 
harp sting hum, turn this water into 
rum.

            HARRY

What's Seamus trying to do to that glass 
of water?

            RON WEASLEY

Turn it to rum. Actually he managed 
to make weak tea yesterday, before--- 
Ah, mail's here.

            HARRY

Can I burrow this? Thanks.

            OTH

Hey look! Neville's got a Remembrall.


            HERMIONE

I've read about those. When the smoke 
turns red it means you've forgotten 
something.

            NEVILLE

The only problem is I can't remember 
what I have forgotten.

            HARRY

Hey Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts. 
Listen: "Believed to be the work of 
Dark wizards or witches unknown, Gringotts 
goblins were acknowledging the breach 
insist nothing was taken. The vault 
in question number 713 had been emptied 
earlier that very same day." That's 
odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went 
to.

            MHARRY

Good afternoon, class.

            OTHS

Good afternoon Madame Hooch.

            MHARRY

Good afternoon Amanda, good afternoon. 
Welcome to your first flying lesson. 
Well what are you waiting for? Everyone 
step up to the left side of their broomstick. 
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right 
hand over the broom and say up.

            H & OTHS

Up! Up!

            HARRY

Woah!

            DRACO MALFOY

Up.

            RON WEASLEY

Up. Up!

            MHARRY

With feeling!

            HERMIONE

Up. Up! Up. Up!

            RON WEASLEY

UP! Ow! Shut up HARRY.

            MHARRY

Now once you've got hold of your broom, 
I want you to mount it. Grip it tight. 
You don't wanna be sliding off the end. 
When I blow my whistle, I want each 
of you to kick off from the ground, 
hard. Keep your broom steady, hover 
for a moment, then lean forward slightly 
and touch back down. On my whistle. 
Three, two... Mr. Longbottom. Mr. Mr. 
Mr. Longbottom!

            OTHS

Down! Down!

            HARRY

Neville!

            NEVILLE

Help! Help!

            MHARRY

Come back down this instant! Mr. Longbottom! 
Everyone out of the way!

            HERMIONE

Is he alright?

            NEVILLE

Ow!

            MHARRY

Oh oh oh. Oh dear, it's a broken wrist. 
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get. Everyone 
is to keep their feet firmly on the 
ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to 
the hospital wing. Understand? If I 
see a single broom in the air the one 
riding it will find themselves out of 
Hogwarts before they can say "Quidditch".


            DRACO MALFOY

Did you see his face? If the fat lump 
had given this a squeeze he would remember 
to fall on his fat arse.

            HARRY

Give it here Malfoy.

            DRACO MALFOY

No, I think I'll leave it somewhere 
for Longbottom to find. How about on 
the roof? What's the matter Potter? 
Bit beyond you reach?

            HERMIONE

HARRY! No way! You heard what Madame 
Hooch said. Besides you don't even know 
how to fly! What an idiot!

            HARRY

Give it here Malfoy or I'll knock you 
off your broom!

            DRACO MALFOY

Is that so? Have it your way, then!


            OTH

Yeah!

            OTH

Nice going, HARRY!

            OTH

That was wicked HARRY!

            MCGONAGALL

HARRY Potter! Follow me. You wait here.


            QUIRRELL

... this is an ingredient...

            MCGONAGALL

Professor Quirrell, excuse me, excuse 
me could I borrow Wood for a moment, 
please?

            QUIRRELL

Well, yes of course.

            MCGONAGALL

Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood I 
have found you a Seeker. 

            



            

- - - -

            SIR NEVILLE

Have you heard HARRY Potter's the new 
Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew he'd 
do well.

            RON WEASLEY

Seeker? But first years never make the 
house teams. You must be the youngest 
Quidditch player in...

            HARRY

A century. According to McGonagall.


            FRED WEASLEY

Well dome HARRY! Wood's just told us!


            RON WEASLEY

Fred and George are on the team too. 
Beaters.

            GEORGE WEASLEY

Our job is to make sure that you don't 
get bloody up too bad. Can't make any 
promises of course. Rough game Quidditch.


            FRED WEASLEY

Brutal! But, nobody's died in years. 
Someone vanishes occasionally.

            GEORGE WEASLEY

But they'll turn up in a month or two!


            RON WEASLEY

Oh go on HARRY! Quidditch is great. 
Best game there is, and you'll be great 
too!

            HARRY

But I've never even played Quidditch! 
What if I make a fool of myself?

            HERMIONE

You won't make a fool of yourself. It's 
in your blood.

            RON WEASLEY

Woah! HARRY, you never told me your 
father was a seeker too!

            HARRY

I didn't know.

            


            

- - - -

            RON WEASLEY

I'm telling you, it's spooky! She knows 
move about you than you do!

            HARRY

Who doesn't? What's happening?

            HERMIONE

The staircases change remember?

            HARRY

Let's go this way.

            RON WEASLEY

Before the staircase moves again. Does 
anybody feel like we shouldn't be here?


            HERMIONE

We're not supposed to be here. This 
is the third floor. It's forbidden!


            HARRY

Let's go.

            HERMIONE

Flich's cat!

            HARRY

Run! Quick, let's hide through that 
door! It's locked!

            RON WEASLEY

that's it we're done for!

            HERMIONE

Oh! Move over! Alohomora! Get in!

            RON WEASLEY

Alohomora?

            HERMIONE

Standard Book Of Spells- Chapter 7!


            FILCH

Any one here my sweet? Come on.

            HERMIONE

He thinks this door is locked.

            RON WEASLEY

He thinks this door is locked.

            HERMIONE

It was locked.

            HARRY

And for good reason.

            H, R, & HERMIONE

AH!

            RON WEASLEY

What do they think they're doing? Keeping 
a thing like that locked up in a school?


            HERMIONE

You don't use your eyes do you? Didn't 
you see what it was standing on?

            RON WEASLEY

I wasn't looking at its feet! I was 
a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or 
maybe you didn't notice... the three!


            HERMIONE

It was standing on a trap door. It wasn't 
there by accident. It's guarding something.


            HARRY

Guarding something?

            HERMIONE

That's right. Now, if you two don't 
mind, I'm going to bed before either 
of you come up with another clever idea 
to get killed or worse... expelled.


            RON WEASLEY

She needs to sort out her priorities.

            OLIVER WOOD

Quidditch is easy enough to understand. 
Each team has 7 players. Three Chasers, 
two Beaters, one Keeper and a Seeker, 
that's you. There are three kinds of 
balls. This one's called the Quaffle. 
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try 
to put it through one of those three 
hoops. The Keeper, that's me, defends 
the hoops. With me so far?

            HARRY

I think so. What are those?

            OLIVER WOOD

You better take this. Careful now, it's 
coming back. Not bad Potter, you'd make 
a fair Beater. Uh-oh.

            HARRY

What was that?

            OLIVER WOOD

Bludgers. Nasty little buggers. But 
you are a Seeker. The only thing I want 
you to worry about is this, the Golden 
Snitch.

            HARRY

I like this ball.

            OLIVER WOOD

Eh, you like it now. But it's wicked 
fast and damn near impossible to see.


            HARRY

What do I do with it?

            OLIVER WOOD

You catch it. Before the other team's 
Seeker. You catch this the game's over. 
You catch this, Potter, and we win.


            HARRY

Woah!

            

- - - -

            PROFESSOR FLITWICK

One of a wizard's most rudimental skill 
is levitation or the ability to make 
objects fly. Do you all have your feathers? 
Good. Now don't forget the nice wrist 
movement we've been practicing. Hum! 
The "Swish and Flick". Everyone, the 
"Swish and Flick". Good! Oh and annunciate! 
Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then!


            OTHS

Wingardium Leviosa; Wingardium Leviosa!


            RON WEASLEY

Wingardium Leviosa!

            HERMIONE

No, stop stop stop! You're going to 
take someone's eye out! Besides, you're 
saying it wrong. It's Levi-o-sa, not 
Leviosar.

            RON WEASLEY

You do it then if you're so clever. 
Go on, go on!

            HERMIONE

Wingardium Leviosa.

            PROFESSOR FLITWICK

Oh oh! Well done! See here everyone, 
Miss Granger's done it! Ho ho! Splendid!


            SFRED WEASLEY

Wingard-Leviosa; Wingard-- Leviosa


            PROFESSOR FLITWICK

Well done dear. OH!

            HARRY

I think we're going to need another 
feather over here professor.

            RON WEASLEY

"It's Levi-o-sa not Leviosar." She's 
a nightmare honestly! It's no wonder 
she hasn't got any friends!

            HARRY

I think she heard you.

            


            HARRY

Where's Hermione?

            NEVILLE

Parvati Patil said she's wouldn't come 
out of the girl's bathroom. She said 
she's been there all afternoon, crying.


            QUIRRELL

Troll in the dungeon! Troll in the dungeon! 
Though you ought to know.

            OTHS

Ah!

            DUMBLEDORE

SILENCE! Everyone will please not panic! 
Now prefects please escort your house 
to the dormitories. Teachers will follow 
me to the dungeons.

            PERCY

Gryffindors, keep up, please, and stay 
alert!

            HARRY

How could a troll get in?

            RON WEASLEY

Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid. 
Probably people playing jokes. What?


            HARRY

Hermione! She doesn't know!

            RON WEASLEY

I think the troll's left the dungeon!


            HARRY

It's going into the girl's bathroom. 
Hermione move!

            HERMIONE

Help! Help!

            RON WEASLEY

Hey, pea brain!

            HERMIONE

Ah! Help!

            HARRY

Woah!

            RON WEASLEY

Ugh!

            HARRY

Do something!

            RON WEASLEY

What?

            HARRY

Anything! Hurry up!

            HERMIONE

"Swish & Flick!"

            RON WEASLEY

Wingardium Leviosa! Cool.

            HERMIONE

Is it dead?

            HARRY

No just knocked out.

            HARRY

Ugh.

            RON WEASLEY

Troll boogies.

            MCGONAGALL

Oh my goodness! Explain yourselves both 
of you!

            H & RON WEASLEY

Well what it is-

            HERMIONE

It's my fault Professor Mc Gonagall


            MCGONAGALL

Miss. Granger?

            HERMIONE

I went looking for the troll I've read 
about them and I though I could handle 
it. But I was wrong.  If HARRY and Ron 
hadn’t come and found me... I’d probably 
be dead.

            MCGONAGALL

Be that as it may, it was an extremely 
foolish thing to do. I would have expected 
more rational behavior on your part 
and am very disappointed in you Miss. 
Granger. Five points will be taken from 
Gryffindor for your serious lack of 
judgement. As for you two gentle I just 
hope you realize how fortunate you are. 
Not many first year students could take 
on a fully grown mountain troll and 
live to tell the tale. Five points will 
be awarded to each of you, for sheer 
dumb luck.

            QUIRRELL

Perhaps you ought to go. It might wake 
up.

            

- - - -

            RON WEASLEY

Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

            HERMIONE

Ron's right HARRY, you're going to need 
your strength today.

            HARRY

I'm not hungry.

            SEVERUS SNAPE

Good luck today, Potter. Then again, 
now that you've proven yourself against 
a troll, a little game of Quidditch 
should be easy work for you. Even if 
it is against Slytherin.

            HARRY

That explains the blood.

            HERMIONE

Blood?

            HARRY

Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape 
let the troll in as diversion so he 
could get past that three headed dog. 
But, he got bit, that's why he's limping.


            HERMIONE

But why would anyone go near that dog?


            HARRY

The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took 
something out of one of the vaults. 
Said it was Hogwarts business, very 
secret.

            HERMIONE

So you're saying- -

            HARRY

That's what the dog's guarding. That's 
what Snape wants.

            HERMIONE

A bit early for mail isn't it?

            HARRY

But, I never get mail.

            RON WEASLEY

Let's open it.

            HARRY

It's a broomstick.

            RON WEASLEY

It's not just a broomstick, HARRY. It's 
a Nimbus 2000!

            HARRY

But who--?

            


            OLIVER WOOD

Scared, HARRY?

            HARRY

A little.

            OLIVER WOOD

It's alright. I felt the same way before 
my first game.

            HARRY

What happened?

            OLIVER WOOD

I.. uh...I don't really remember... 
Took a Bludger to the head two minutes 
in. Woke in the hospital a week later.


            LJ

Hello! Welcome to Hogwart's first Quidditch 
game of the season! Today's game: Slytherin 
vs. Gryffindor! The player take their 
positions as Madam Hooch steps onto 
the field to begin the game!

            MHARRY

Now, I want a nice clean game... from 
all of you.

            LJ

The Bludgers are up. Followed by the 
Golden Snitch. Remember the Snitch is 
worth 150 points. The Seeker who catches 
the Snitch ends the game. The Quaffle 
is released and the game begins! Anjelina 
Johnson scores! Ten points for Gryffindor!


            HAGRID

Well done!

            LJ

Slytherin takes the Quaffle. Bletchley 
passes to Captain Marcus Flint. Another 
ten points to Gryffindor!

            MFRED WEASLEY

Give me that! Take that side!

            HAGRID

What's going on with HARRY's broomstick?


            HERMIONE

It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!


            RON WEASLEY

Jinxing the broom?! What do we do?


            HERMIONE

Leave it to me!

            RON WEASLEY

Come on Hermione!

            HERMIONE

Lacarnum Inflamarae.

            OTH

Fire! You're on fire!

            HAGRID

Go, go, go, go! Looks like he's gonna 
be sick!

            LJ

He's got the Snitch! HARRY Potter receives 
150 points for catching the Snitch!


            MHARRY

Gryffindor wins!

            HAGRID

Yes!

            OTHS

HARRY Potter Gyffindor! HARRY Potter 
Gyffindor! HARRY Potter Gyffindor! HARRY 
Potter Gyffindor! HARRY Potter Gyffindor!


            


            

- - - -

            HAGRID

Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse 
on HARRY's broom?

            HARRY

Who knows? Why was he trying to get 
past that three-headed dog on Halloween?


            HAGRID

Who told you about Fluffy?

            RON WEASLEY

Fluffy?

            HERMIONE

That thing has a name?

            HAGRID

Well, of course, he's got a name! He's 
mine! I brought him off an Irish feller 
I met down at the pub last year. Then 
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the---


            HARRY

Yes?

            HAGRID

I shouldn't have said that. No more 
questions! Don't ask anymore question! 
That's top- secret that is.

            HARRY

But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding 
Snape's trying to steal it!

            HAGRID

Codswallop! Professor Snape is a Hogwarts 
teacher!

            HERMIONE

Hogwarts teacher or not I know a spell 
when I see one! I've read all about 
them. You've got to keep eye contact 
and Snape wasn't blinking!

            HARRY

Exactly.

            HAGRID

Now listen to me, all three of you, 
you're meddling in things that ought 
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous! 
What that dog is guarding is strictly 
between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas 
Flamel.

            HARRY

Nicholas Flamel?

            HAGRID

I shouldn't have said that. I should 
not have said that.

            HARRY

Nicholas Flamel. Who's Nicholas Flamel?


            HERMIONE

I don't know.

            


            HOGWART GHOSTS

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas. Ring 
the Hogwart bell. Merry Christmas, Merry 
Christmas. Cast a Christmas spell.


            HARRY

Knight to E-5.

            RON WEASLEY

Queen to E-5.

            HERMIONE

That's totally barbaric!

            RON WEASLEY

That's wizard's chess. I see you've 
packed.

            HERMIONE

See you haven't.

            RON WEASLEY

Change of plans. My parents have decided 
to go to Romania to visit my brother 
Charlie. He's studying dragons there.


            HERMIONE

Good. You can help HARRY then. He's 
going to look in the library for information 
on Nicholas Flamel.

            RON WEASLEY

We've looked a hundred times!

            HERMIONE

Not in the Restricted Section. Happy 
Christmas.

            RON WEASLEY

I think we've had a bad influence on 
her.

            


            

- - - -

            RON WEASLEY

HARRY wake up! Come on HARRY! Wake up! 
Happy Christmas HARRY!

            HARRY

Happy Christmas Ron! What are you wearing?


            RON WEASLEY

Oh, my mum made it. Looks like you've 
got one too.

            HARRY

I've got presents?

            RON WEASLEY

Yeah! There they are.

            HARRY

"Your father left this in my possession 
before he died. It is time it was returned 
to you. Use it well."?

            RON WEASLEY

What is it?

            HARRY

Some kind of cloak.

            RON WEASLEY

Well let's see then! Put it on! Woah!


            HARRY

My body is gone!

            RON WEASLEY

I know what that is! That's an Invisibility 
Cloak!

            HARRY

I'm invisible?

            RON WEASLEY

They're really rare. I wonder who gave 
it to you.

            HARRY

There was no name. It just said, "Use 
it well."

            HARRY

Famous Fire Eaters. Fifteenth Century 
Fiends. Flamel. Nicholas Flamel. Where 
are you?

            FILCH

I know you're in there. You can't hide. 
Who is it? Show yourself!

            QUIRRELL

Severus I-I-I

            SEVERUS SNAPE

You don't want me as your enemy Quirrell.


            QUIRRELL

I don't know what you mean.

            SEVERUS SNAPE

You know perfectly well what I mean. 
We'll have another little chat soon. 
When you've had time to decide where 
your loyalties lie.

            FILCH

Professors. I found this in the Restricted 
Section. It's still hot. That means 
there's a student out of bed.

            HARRY

Mum, Dad? Ron! You've really gotta see 
this! Ron! You've gotta see this! Ron! 
Come on, get out of bed!

            RON WEASLEY

Why?

            HARRY

There's something you've got to see! 
Now, come on! Come on! Come! Come look! 
It's my parents!

            RON WEASLEY

I only see us.

            HARRY

Look in properly. Go on, stand there. 
There. You see them don't you? That's---


            RON WEASLEY

That's me! Only, I'm Head Boy. And I'm 
holding the Quidditch Cup. And bloody 
hell! I'm Quidditch captain too! I look 
good! HARRY, do you think this mirror 
shows the future?

            HARRY

How can it? Both my parents are dead.


            


            DUMBLEDORE

Back again HARRY? I see that you, like 
many others before you have discovered 
the delights of the Mirror of Erised. 
I trust now, you realize what it what 
it does. Let me give you a clue. The 
happiest man on earth would look in 
the mirror and only see himself exactly 
as he is.

            HARRY

So then, it shows us what we want... 
Whatever we want?

            DUMBLEDORE

Yes, and no. It shows us nothing more 
or less then the deepest and most desperate 
desires of our hearts. Now you HARRY, 
who have never known your family you 
see them standing beside you. But remember 
this, HARRY. This mirror gives us neither 
knowledge or truth. Men have wasted 
away in front of it. Even gone mad. 
That is why tomorrow it will be moved 
to a new home. And I must ask you not 
to go looking for it again. It does 
not do to dwell on dreams, HARRY, and 
forget to live.

            

- - - -

            HERMIONE

I had you looking in the wrong section! 
How could I be so stupid? I checked 
this out weeks ago for a bit of light 
reading!

            RON WEASLEY

This is light?

            HERMIONE

Of course! Here it is! "Nicholas Flamel 
is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's 
Stone

            H&RON WEASLEY

The what?

            HERMIONE

Honestly don't you two read? "The Sorcerer's 
Stone is a legendary substance with 
astonishing powers. It will transform 
any metal into pure gold and produce 
the Elixir of Life which will make the 
drinker immortal."

            RON WEASLEY

Immortal!

            HERMIONE

It means you'll never die.

            RON WEASLEY

I know what it means!

            HERMIONE

The only stone currently in existence 
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the 
noted alchemist who last year celebrated 
his 665th birthday." That's what Fluffy's 
guarding on the third floor. That's 
what's under the trap door. The Sorcerer's 
Stone.

            HARRY

Hagrid!

            HAGRID

Oh, hello. I don't wish to be rude, 
but I'm in no fit state to entertain 
today.

            H&R&HERMIONE

We know about the Sorcerer's Stone!


            

g; Oh.

            HARRY

We think Snape's trying to steal it.


            HAGRID

Snape? Blimey, you're still on about 
him, are you?

            HARRY

Hagrid! We know he's after the Stone 
we just don't know why!

            HAGRID

Snape is one of the teachers protecting 
the Stone! He's not about to steal it.


            HARRY

What?

            HAGRID

You heard. Right, now, come on, I'm 
a bit preoccupied today.

            HARRY

Wait a minute! "One of the teachers"?


            HERMIONE

Of course! There are other things defending 
the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments?


            HAGRID

Right. Waste of bloody time if you ask 
me. Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. 
Ain't a soul knows how, except me and 
Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you 
that. I should not have told you that.


            HARRY

Hagrid, what exactly is that?

            HAGRID

Oh, That? It's a...it's um...

            RON WEASLEY

I know what that is! But Hagrid how 
did you get one?

            HAGRID

I won it! Off a stranger I met at the 
pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid of 
it, as a matter of fact.

            HERMIONE

Is that...a dragon?

            RON WEASLEY

That's not just a dragon! That's a Norwegian 
Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works 
with these in Romania.

            HAGRID

Isn't he beautiful? Oh bless him look, 
he knows his mummy! Hello Norbert!


            HARRY

Norbert?

            HAGRID

Well he's gotta have a name don't he? 
Don't you Norbert? Te de de de de! Oh! 
Woah! He'll have to be trained up a 
bit of course. Who's that?

            HARRY

Malfoy.

            HAGRID

Oh, dear.

            HARRY

Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told 
me so the first time I ever met him.


            RON WEASLEY

It's crazy! And worse Malfoy knows.


            HERMIONE

I don't understand. Is that bad?

            RON WEASLEY

It's bad.

            MCGONAGALL

Good evening. Nothing I repeat nothing 
gives a student the right to walk about 
the school at night. Therefore as punishment 
for your actions, 50 points will be 
taken.

            HARRY

50!

            MCGONAGALL

Each. And to ensure that it doesn't 
happen again all four of you will receive 
detention.

            DRACO MALFOY

Excuse me professor. Perhaps I heard 
you wrong. I thought you said the four 
of us.

            MCGONAGALL

No you heard me correctly Mr. Malfoy. 
You see, honorable as your intentions 
were you too were out of bed after hours. 
You will join you classmates in detention.


            


            FILCH

A pity they let the old punishments 
die. Was a time detention found you 
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. 
God, I'll miss the screaming. You'll 
be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. 
He's got a little job to do inside the 
Dark Forest. A sorry lot, this, Hagrid. 
Oh good God you're not still on about 
that bloody dragon now are you?

            HAGRID

Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him 
off to Romania to live in a colony.


            HERMIONE

Well, that's good isn't it? He'll be 
with his own kind.

            HAGRID

Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? 
What if the other dragons are mean to 
him? He's only a baby after all.

            FILCH

Oh, for God's sake pull yourself together 
man. You're going into the Forest after 
all. Got to have your wits about you.


            DRACO MALFOY

The Forest? I thought that was a joke. 
We can't go in there. Students aren't 
allowed. And there are... werewolves!


            FILCH

Ah, there's more that werewolves in 
those trees, lad. You can be sure of 
that. Nighty- night.

            HAGRID

Right, let's go.

            


            HARRY

Hagrid, what is that?

            HAGRID

What we're here for. See that? That's 
unicorn blood, that is. I found one 
dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's 
been hurt bad by something. So, it's 
our job to go and find the poor beast. 
Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.


            RON WEASLEY

Okay...

            HAGRID

And HARRY, you'll go with Malfoy.

            DRACO MALFOY

Okay, then I get Fang!

            HAGRID

Fine. Just so you know he's bloody coward.


            DRACO MALFOY

Wait till my father hears about this! 
This is servant stuff.

            HARRY

If I didn't know better Draco, I'd say 
you were scared.

            DRACO MALFOY

Scared Potter. Did you hear that?

            HARRY

Come on Fang!

            DRACO MALFOY

Scared!

            


            HARRY

What is it Fang?

            DRACO MALFOY

AH!

            FIRENZE

HARRY Potter, you must leave. You are 
known to many creatures here. The Forest 
is not safe at this time. Especially 
for you.

            HARRY

But what was that thing you saved me 
from?

            FIRENZE

A monstrous creature. It is a terrible 
crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the 
blood of a unicorn will keep you alive 
even if you are an inch from death. 
But at a terrible price. For you have 
slain something so pure that the moment 
the blood touches your lips you have 
a half-life, a cursed life.

            HARRY

But who would choose such a life?

            FIRENZE

Can you think of no one?

            HARRY

You mean to say that thing that killed 
the unicorn, that was drinking its blood, 
that was Voldemort?

            FIRENZE

Do you know what is hidden in the school 
at this very moment, Mr. Potter?

            HARRY

The Sorcerer's Stone!

            HERMIONE

HARRY!

            HAGRID

Hello there Firenze. See you've met 
our young Mr. Potter. All right there 
HARRY?

            FIRENZE

HARRY Potter, this is where I leave 
you. You are safe now. Good luck.


            


            HERMIONE

You mean, that You- Know- Who is out 
there right now in the Forest?

            HARRY

But he's weak. He's living off of unicorns. 
Don't you see? We had it wrong! Snape 
doesn't want the Stone for himself. 
He wants the Stone for Voldemort. With 
the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will become 
strong again. He, he'll come back.


            RON WEASLEY

But if he comes back, you don't think 
he'll try to kill you, do you?

            HARRY

I think if he had his chance he would 
have tried to kill me tonight.

            RON WEASLEY

And to think, I've been worrying about 
my Potions final.

            HERMIONE

Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one 
thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort 
is always feared? Dumbledore. As long 
as Dumbledore's around, HARRY, you're 
safe. As long as Dumbledore's around 
you can't be touched.

            


            

- - - -

            HERMIONE

I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were 
frightful, but I found they're rather 
enjoyable

            RON WEASLEY

Speak for yourself. All right there 
HARRY?

            HARRY

My scar. It keeps burning.

            HERMIONE

It's happened before.

            HARRY

Not like this.

            RON WEASLEY

Perhaps you should see the nurse.

            HARRY

I think it's a warning. It means danger's 
coming. Ah. Oh, Of Course.

            HERMIONE

What is it?

            HARRY

Don't you think it's a bit odd that 
what Hagrid want more than anything 
is a dragon and a stranger turns up 
and just happens to have one? I mean, 
how many people wander around with dragon 
eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I 
see it before? Hagrid, who gave you 
that dragon egg? What did he look like?


            HAGRID

I dunno. I never saw his face. He kept 
his hood up.

            HARRY

This stranger though, you and he must 
have talked.

            HAGRID

Well, he wanted to know what sort of 
creatures I looked after. And I told 
him, after Fluffy a dragon's gonna be 
no problem.

            HARRY

Did he seem interested in Fluffy?

            HAGRID

Well of course he was interested in 
Fluffy! How often do you come across 
three headed dogs do you come across 
even if you're in the trade? But I told 
him, I said, I said, "The trick with 
any beast is to know how to calm him." 
Take Fluffy for example, just play him 
a bit of music and he falls straight 
asleep. I shouldn't have told you that. 
Where are you going? Where are you---?


            


            HARRY

We have to see professor Dumbledore 
immediately!

            HARRY

We have to see Professor Dumbledore 
immediately!

            MCGONAGALL

I’m afraid Professor Dumbledore’s not 
here. He received an urgent owl from 
the Ministry of Magic and left immediately 
for London.

            HARRY

He’s gone! But this is important! This 
is about the Sorcerer’s Stone!

            MCGONAGALL

How did you know ---?

            HARRY

Someone’s going to try to steal it!


            MCGONAGALL

I don’t know how you three found out 
about the Stone but I assure you it 
is perfectly well protected. Now would 
you go back to your dormitories quietly.


            HARRY

That was no stranger Hagrid met. It 
was Snape. Which means that he knows 
how to get past Fluffy.

            HERMIONE

And with Dumbledore gone---

            SEVERUS SNAPE

Good afternoon. Now, what would three 
young Gryffindors, such as yourselves 
be doing inside on a day like this?


            HERMIONE

We were... we were just---

            SEVERUS SNAPE

You’d ought to be careful. People willht 
think you’re up to something.

            HERMIONE

Now what are we do?

            HARRY

We go down the trap door, tonight.


            


            HARRY

Trevor.

            RON WEASLEY

Trevor, sh, go you shouldn’t be here!


            NEVILLE

Neither should you. You’re sneaking 
out again aren’t you?

            HARRY

Now Neville listen. We were... we were---


            NEVILLE

No I won’t let you! You’ll get Gryffindor 
into trouble again! I’ll, I’ll fight 
you!

            HERMIONE

Neville, I’m really really sorry about 
this. Petrificus totalus!

            RON WEASLEY

You’re a little scary sometimes, you 
know that. Brilliant, but scary.  


            HARRY

Let’s go.

            HARRY

Sorry.

            HERMIONE

Sorry.

            RON WEASLEY

It’s for your own good you know.

            


            HERMIONE

Ow! You stood on my foot!

            

Sorry.

            HERMIONE

Alohomora.

            HARRY

Wait a minute. He’s snoring. Snape’s 
already been here. He’s put a spell 
on the harp.

            RON WEASLEY

Ugh! It’s got horrible breath.

            HARRY

We have to move its paw.

            RON WEASLEY

What?

            HARRY

Come on! Okay, push! I’ll go first. 
Don’t follow me until I give you a sign. 
If something bad happens get yourselves 
out! Does it seem a bit quiet to you?


            HERMIONE

The harp, it stopped playing.

            RON WEASLEY

Ugh! Yuck! Ugh!

            HARRY

Jump!

            RON WEASLEY

Woah! Lucky this plant thing’s here 
really! Woah!

            HERMIONE

Stop moving, both of you! This is Devil’s 
Snare. You have to relax! If you don’t 
it’ll only kill you faster!

            RON WEASLEY

Kill us faster? Oh now I can relax!


            R&HARRY

Hermione!

            RON WEASLEY

Oh now what are we going to do?

            HERMIONE

Just relax!

            HARRY

Hermione where are you?

            HERMIONE

Do what I say! Trust me!

            RON WEASLEY

Ah! HARRY! HARRY!

            HERMIONE

Are you okay?

            HARRY

Yeah, yeah I’m fine. (Ron Weasley: Help!)


            HERMIONE

He’s not relaxing is he? (Ron Weasley: 
Help!)

            HARRY

Apparently not. (Ron Weasley: Help me!)


            HERMIONE

We’ve got to do something! (Ron Weasley: 
Help!)

            HARRY

What? (Ron Weasley: Help!)

            HERMIONE

I remember reading something in Herbology. 
(Ron Weasley: Help!) “Devil’s Snare 
Devil’s Snare it’s deadly fun; but will 
sulk in the sun.” That’s it! Devil’s 
Snare hates sunlight! Lumus Solem!


            HARRY

Ron, are you okay?

            RON WEASLEY

Yeah. Lucky we didn’t panic!

            

Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.


            HERMIONE

What is that?

            HARRY

I don’t know Sounds like wings.

            HERMIONE

Curious, I’ve never seen birds like 
these.

            HARRY

They’re not birds they’re keys. And 
I’ll bet one of then fits that door.


            HERMIONE

What’s this all about?

            HARRY

I don’t know. Strange.

            RON WEASLEY

Alohomora! Well, it was worth a try.


            HERMIONE

What are we going to do? There must 
be a thousand keys up there!

            RON WEASLEY

We’re looking for a big old fashioned 
one. Probably rusty like the handle.


            HARRY

There! I see it! The one with the broken 
wing!

            HERMIONE

What’s wrong HARRY?

            HARRY

It is too simple.

            RON WEASLEY

Oh, go on HARRY! If Snape can catch 
it on that old broomstick, you can! 
You’re the youngest Seeker in a century! 
This complicates things a bit!

            HARRY

Catch the key!

            RON WEASLEY

Hurry up!

            


            HERMIONE

I don’t like this. I don’t like this 
at all.

            HARRY

Where are we? A graveyard?

            RON WEASLEY

This is no graveyard, it’s a chessboard.


            HARRY

There’s the door!

            HERMIONE

Now what do we do?

            RON WEASLEY

Its obvious isn’t it? We’ve got to play 
our way across the room. All right, 
HARRY, you take the empty bishop’s square. 
Hermione you’ll be the queen-side castle. 
As for me, I’ll be a knight.

            HERMIONE

What happens now?

            RON WEASLEY

Well, white moves first, and then we 
play.

            HERMIONE

Ron you don’t suppose this’ll be like 
real wizard’s chess do you?

            RON WEASLEY

You there D-5. Yes Hermione I think 
this is gonna be exactly like wizard’s 
chess. Castle to E-4! Pawn to C-3!


            HARRY

Wait a minute.

            RON WEASLEY

You understand right HARRY. Once I make 
my move the queen will take me. Then 
you’re free to check the king.

            HARRY

No. Ron no!

            HERMIONE

What is it?

            HARRY

He is going to sacrifice himself!

            HERMIONE

No you can’t! There must be another 
way!

            RON WEASLEY

Do you wanna stop Snape from getting 
that Stone or not? HARRY, it’s you that 
has to go on. I know it! Not me! Not 
Hermione! You! Knight to H-3. Check. 
Ah!

            HARRY

Ron! No don’t move! Don’t forget we’re 
still playing! Checkmate! Take care 
of Ron then go to the owlery. Send a 
message to Dumbledore. Ron’s right. 
I have to go on.

            HERMIONE

You’ll be okay HARRY. You’re a great 
wizard. You really are.

            HARRY

Not as good as you.

            HERMIONE

Me? Books, cleverness. There are more 
important things. Friendship and bravery. 
And HARRY, just be careful.

            


            HARRY

You? No it can’t be; Snape he was he 
was the one---

            QUIRRELL

Yes he does seem the type doesn’t he? 
Next to him who would suspect p-p-poor 
st-st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?


            HARRY

But that day, during the Quidditch match, 
Snape tried to kill me.

            QUIRRELL

Oh no dear boy, I tried to kill you! 
And trust me if Snape’s cloak hadn’t 
caught on fire and broken my eye contact 
I would have succeeded. Even with Snape 
muttering his little counter-curse.


            HARRY

Snape was trying to save me?

            QUIRRELL

I knew you were a danger to me right 
from the off. Especially after Halloween.


            HARRY

Then then you let the troll in!

            QUIRRELL

Very good Potter yes. Snape unfortunately 
wasn’t fooled, when every one else was 
running about the dungeon Snape went 
to the third floor to head me of. He 
of course never trusted me again. He 
rarely left me alone. But he doesn’t 
understand, I’m never alone. Never. 
Now does this mirror do? I see what 
I desire. I see myself holding the Stone. 
But how do I get it?

            VOLDEMORT

Use the boy.

            QUIRRELL

Come here Potter! Now! Tell me what 
do you see? What is it what do you see?


            HARRY

I’m shaking hands with Dumbledore. I’ve 
won the House Cup.

            VOLDEMORT

He lies.

            QUIRRELL

Tell the truth! What do you see?

            VOLDEMORT

Let me speak to him.

            QUIRRELL

Master you are not strong enough.

            VOLDEMORT

have strength enough for this. HARRY 
Potter, we meet again.

            HARRY

Voldemort?

            VOLDEMORT

Yes, you see what I have become? See 
what I must do to survive? Live off 
another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood 
can sustain me but it cannot give me 
a body of my own. But there is something 
that can. Something that conveniently 
enough lies in your pocket. Stop him! 
Don’t be a fool! Why suffer a horrific 
death when you can join with me and 
live?

            HARRY

Never!

            VOLDEMORT

Bravery, your parents had it too. Tell 
me HARRY would you like to see your 
mother and father again? Together we 
can bring them back. All I ask is for 
something in return. That’s it HARRY. 
There is no good and evil, there is 
only power and those too weak to seek 
it. Together we'll do extraordinary 
things. Just give me the Stone!

            HARRY

You liar!

            VOLDEMORT

Kill him!

            QUIRRELL

What is this magic?

            VOLDEMORT

Fool get the Stone! 

            


            DUMBLEDORE

Good afternoon HARRY. Tokens from your 
admirers.

            HARRY

Admirers?

            DUMBLEDORE

What happened down in the dungeons between 
you and Professor Quirrell is a complete 
secret. So naturally the whole school 
knows. Ah, I see that your friend Ronald 
has saved you the trouble of opening 
your Chocolate Frogs.

            HARRY

Ron was here? Is he alright? What about 
Hermione?

            DUMBLEDORE

Fine. They're both just fine.

            HARRY

Bu, what happened to the Stone?

            DUMBLEDORE

Relax dear boy. The Stone has been destroyed. 
My friend Nicholas and I have had a 
little chat and agreed it was best all 
around.

            HARRY

But then Flamel, he'll die won't he?


            DUMBLEDORE

He has enough Elixir of Life to set 
his affairs in order. But yes, he will 
die.

            HARRY

How is it I got the Stone sir? One minute 
I was there staring in the mirror and 
then the next---

            DUMBLEDORE

Ah, you see only a person who wanted 
to find the Stone, find it, but not 
use it would be able to get it. That 
is one of my more brilliant ideas. And 
between you and me that is saying something.


            HARRY

Does that mean with the Stone gone that 
is, that Voldemort can never come back?


            DUMBLEDORE

Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which 
he can return. HARRY do you know why 
Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to 
have you touch him? It was because of 
your mother. She sacrificed herself 
for you. And that kind of act leaves 
a mark. No, no this kind of mark cannot 
be seen. It lives in your very skin.


            HARRY

What is it?

            DUMBLEDORE

Love HARRY. Love. Bertie Bott's Every 
Flavor Beans. I was most unfortunate 
in my youth to come across a vomit flavor 
one. Since then I'm afraid I've lost 
my liking for them. But I think I could 
be safe with a nice toffee. Alas! Earwax!


            HARRY

Alright there Ron?

            RON WEASLEY

Alright. You?

            HARRY

Alright. Hermione?

            HERMIONE

Never better.

            


            DUMBLEDORE

Another year gone. And now as I understand 
it, the House Cup needs awarding. And 
the points stand as thus: In fourth 
place, Gryffindor with 312 points. Third 
place, Hufflepuff with 352 points. In 
second place Ravenclaw with 426 points. 
And in first place, with 472 points, 
Slytherin House.

            DRACO MALFOY

Nice one mate.

            DUMBLEDORE

Yes, yes. Well-done Slytherin. Well-done 
Slytherin. However recent events must 
be taken into account. And I have a 
few last-minute points to award. To 
Miss. Hermione Granger, for the cool 
use of intellect when others were in 
grave peril. 50 points. Second, to Mr. 
Ronald Weasley, for the best-played 
game of chess Hogwarts has seen these 
many years. 50 points. And third, to 
Mr. HARRY Potter, for pure nerve and 
outstanding courage. I award Gryffindor 
House 60 points.

            HERMIONE

We're tied with Slytherin!

            DUMBLEDORE

And finally, it takes a great deal of 
bravery to stand up to your enemies. 
But a great deal more to stand up to 
your friends. I award 10 points to Neville 
Longbottom. Assuming my calculations 
are correct I believe that a change 
of decoration is in order. Gryffindor 
wins the House Cup!

            HAGRID

Yes!

            


            

- - - -

            HAGRID

Come on now. Hurry up, you'll be late! 
Train's leaving. Go on. Come on, hurry 
up.

            HERMIONE

Come on HARRY.

            HARRY

One minute.

            HAGRID

Thought you were leaving without saying 
good-bye did you? This is for you.


            HARRY

Thanks Hagrid.

            HAGRID

Oh. Go on. On with you. On with you 
now. On with you. Oh, listen, HARRY. 
If that dolt of a cousin of yours Dudley 
gives you any grief you can always um... 
threaten him, with a nice pair of ears 
to go with that tail of his.

            HARRY

But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do 
magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.


            HAGRID

I know that. But your cousin don't do 
he?

            HERMIONE

Feels strange to be going home doesn't 
it?

            HARRY

I'm not going home. Not really.

            

        THE END
