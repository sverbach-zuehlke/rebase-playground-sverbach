## How to Play

### Getting started

1. **Clone the repository**: 

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Rebase-Playground
   ```

2. **Checkout scenario branches**: 

   ```bash
   git checkout <scenario-branch>
   ```

### Rebasing

1. **Ensure your base branch is up to date**:

   ```bash
   git checkout <base-branch>
   git pull
   ```

2. **Checkout your scenario branch**: 

   ```bash
   git checkout <scenario-branch>
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   git checkout -
   ```

3. **Rebase the scenario branch**: 

   ```bash
   git rebase <base-branch>
   ```

4. **Force push**: 

   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

### Interactive Rebasing

1. **Checkout your scenario branch**: 

   ```bash
   git checkout <scenario-branch>
   ```

3. **Start the interactive rebase**: 

   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~<number of commits you would like to change>
   ```

4. **Learn how to use vim**: Check [here](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/getting-started-vim) for a short introduction

2. **Rebasing Public Branches**: Experience the challenges of rebasing when collaborating on public branches.

3. **Interactive Rebasing**: Get hands-on with interactive rebasing, and sculpt your commit history like an artist.

4. **Rebasing Feature Branches**: Rebase a feature branch onto the latest changes in the main branch to prevent a complex merge conflict later down the road.

5. **Rebasing Long-Lived Feature Branches:** Experience how rebasing a long-lived feature branch onto the main branch periodically can help keep the branch up-to-date and reduce the risk of merge conflicts.
