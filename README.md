Welcome to the Rebase Playground, where version history becomes a journey of twists, turns, and lessons! ðŸš€

## About

<img align="right" src="./.memes/happens_to_the_best_of_us.jpeg" width="300" hspace="15">

In this repository, you'll find a collection of scenarios designed to help you master the art of rebasing on GitHub. By exploring these scenarios, you'll learn how to navigate the exciting world of rebase, make your commit history more coherent, and avoid common pitfalls.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Rebase-Playground
   ```

2. **Scenario Branches**: Each scenario is represented by a separate branch. Check out a scenario branch to dive into the action:

   ```bash
   git checkout <scenario-branch>
   ```

3. **Experience the Scenarios**: Within each scenario branch, you'll encounter unique challenges that highlight different aspects of rebasing. From conflicting changes to interactive rebasing, you'll uncover the power of rebasing step by step.

4. **Discussion and Learning**: After experimenting with a scenario, reflect on your experience and join discussions with fellow developers. Share your insights, ask questions, and learn from others' perspectives.

## Scenarios to Explore

1. **Conflicting Changes**: Navigate through conflicting changes and learn how to resolve conflicts during a rebase.

2. **Rebasing Public Branches**: Experience the challenges of rebasing when collaborating on public branches.

3. **Interactive Rebasing**: Get hands-on with interactive rebasing, and sculpt your commit history like an artist.

4. **Rebasing Feature Branches**: Rebase a feature branch onto the latest changes in the main branch to prevent a complex merge conflict later down the road.

5. **Rebasing Long-Lived Feature Branches:** Experience how rebasing a long-lived feature branch onto the main branch periodically can help keep the branch up-to-date and reduce the risk of merge conflicts.
